# Code of conduct

Be kind to one another.

> Good walkers leave no track.  
> Good counters don’t use their fingers.  
> The best door’s unlocked and unopened.  
> The best knot’s not in a rope and can’t be untied.
>
> So wise souls are good at caring for people,  
> never turning their back on anyone.  
> They’re good at looking after things,  
> never turning their back on anything.  
> There’s a light hidden here.
>
> Good people teach people who aren’t good yet;  
> the less good are the makings of the good.  
> Anyone who doesn’t respect a teacher  
> or cherish a student  
> may be clever, but has gone astray.  
> There’s a deep mystery here.
