## Deploying in a development environment

Build and deploy the contracts to a local chain running in Docker with:

```sh
bash scripts/deploy_local.sh juno10j9gpw9t4jsz47qgnkvl5n3zlm2fz72k67rxsg
```

> Note: This Wasm account is from the [default account](default-account.txt), which you can use for testing (DO NOT store any real funds with this account). You can pass in any wasm account address you want to use.

This will run a chain locally in a docker container, then build and deploy the contracts to that chain.

The script will output something like:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAO_TOKEN_CODE_ID=1
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAO_CONTRACT_CODE_ID=2
NEXT_PUBLIC_MULTISIG_CODE_ID=3
NEXT_PUBLIC_C4_GROUP_CODE_ID=4
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAKE_CW20_CODE_ID=5
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=juno1wug8sewp6cedgkmrmvhl3lf3tulagm9hnvy8p0rppz9yjw0g4wtqwrw37d
```

You can then instantiate and interact with contracts.

Note, to send commands to the docker container:

```sh
docker exec -i cosmwasm junod status
```

Some commands require a password which defaults to `xxxxxxxxx`. You can use them like so:

```sh
echo xxxxxxxxx | docker exec -i cosmwasm  junod keys show validator -a
```
